#Please note that the game reads files. Please place the .wav files outside of the src folder in eclipse,
as we did with the csv files for the airlines data project in assignment 5. 

#Please run the game from the VoltorbMain class.

#How to play
Every box contains a value, from 1 to 3, or a Ben Franklin.
Just click on a box to discover whats underneath.
Each time you discover a new number, your score gets multiplied by it (first one is multiplied by 1 of course).
If you discover 2 or 3, you get more points. 1, you get nothing more. And if you find a Ben, the game will show you a ben franklin and the game ends.
You win the game when you discovered all 2 and 3 boxes.
Numbers at the end shows the sum of all numbers in the row/column (number at top of box), and how much zeroes there are (number next to icon). If you would to play again, please feel free to reset the game by clicking the reset button.
